    "<h3>The Battle of Neighborhoods Finding a Better Place in NorthYork, Toronto</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h6>Introduction </h6>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to help people to exploring better facilities around their neighborhood community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of people are shifting to various part of Canada and needed lots of time to search for better housing and reputated neighbourhood schools. Easy access to Barista, Schools, Hyper market, Pharmacy, Clinics, Shopping malls, hospital,etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are creating an analysis report for a people who are shifted to Calgary, Canada for a comparative analysis between neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis includes housing price and neighbourhood school based on the ratings, road connectivity, weather conditions,emergency stuffs like water resources, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "The objective, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shiffting over there.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Housing prices\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Schools based on location, fees, and their ratings.\n",

    "Foursquare API\n",
    "Four-square Foursquare is the most trusted, independent location data platform for understanding how people move through the real world. It has a data warehouse of millions location specific content. Places API use perform location search details.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Usage\n",
    "Using the Application setting of Foursquare API can get a near-by location details and neighourhood community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h6>Data Part</h6>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "\n",
    "Will use NorthYork dataset and get the Geo LatLong & Pin codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a geolocation of the postal codes. Info like\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood\n",
    "Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "Neighborhood Longitude\n",
    "Venue\n",

    "\n",
    "<h6>Methodology</h6>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using K-Means Clustering Approach\n",
    "\n",

    "https://github.com/ShyamSunderRaja1/The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods_Week5/blob/master/Common_neighbourhoodviews.JPG\n",
    "\n",
    "Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",

    "Location Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "North York is a popular destination in Canada. It is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in Alberta city with numerous skyscrapers, owes its rapid growth to its status as the centre of Canadaâ€™s oil industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare API Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "we are using different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific district. To get that information we are using \"Foursquare\" location data. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. we are gathering all the required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h6>Discussion</h6>\n",
    "\n",
    "ML Algo for Clustering and Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the neighborhoods into a group and then make a clusters of information to find similar neighborhoods in a North York. We are using a unsupervised machine learning algorithm called k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h6>Conclusion</h6>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using k-means cluster algorithm to separated the neighborhood into 8 different clusters and for 103 different lattitude and logitude from dataset, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. Using the charts above results presented to a particular neighborhood based on average house prices and school ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has provide the learners to get a hands-on completed implementation practice of ML projects.\n",
